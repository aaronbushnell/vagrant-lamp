# Simple LAMP server using Vagrant

## Before you install
[Install Vagrant 1.6.5](https://www.vagrantup.com/download-archive/v1.6.5.html). Newer versions might not work, so use 1.6.5 for now.

## Installation

1. Create an empty directory that should house all of your projects `mkdir ~/Projects # if available`
2. Clone repo `git clone [repoUrl] ~/Projects/PHP`
3. Kickstart your new Vagrant box `cd ~/Projects/PHP && vagrant up`

You will now have a Vagrant box running at 192.168.55.25
